                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The Aditya-L1 mission will take around 109 Earth days after launch to reach the halo orbit around the
                    L1 point, which is about 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) from Earth. The spacecraft will remain in the
                    halo orbit for its planned mission duration while maintained at a stationkeeping cost of 0.2 ‚Äì 4 m/s
                    per year.[15] The 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) satellite carries seven science payloads with diverse
                    objectives, including but not limited to, the coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal
                    magnetometry, origin and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation (which drives Earth's upper
                    atmospheric dynamics and global climate), coupling of the solar photosphere to chromosphere and
                    corona, in-situ characterisations of the space environment around Earth by measuring energetic
                    particle fluxes and magnetic fields of the solar wind and solar magnetic storms that have adverse
                    effects on space and ground-based technologies.</p>
                <p>
                    Aditya-L1 will be able to provide observations of Sun's photosphere, chromosphere and corona. In
                    addition, an instrument will study the solar energetic particles' flux reaching the L1 orbit, while
                    a magnetometer payload will measure the variation in magnetic field strength at the halo orbit
                    around L1. These payloads have to be placed outside the interference from the Earth's magnetic field
                    and hence could not have been useful in the low Earth orbit as proposed on the original Aditya
                    mission concept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the major unsolved issues in the field of solar physics is that the upper atmosphere of the
                    Sun is 1,000,000 K (1,000,000 ¬∞C; 1,800,000 ¬∞F) hot whereas the lower atmosphere is just 6,000 K
                    (5,730 ¬∞C; 10,340 ¬∞F). In addition, it is not understood how exactly the Sun's radiation affects the
                    dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere on shorter as well as on longer time scale. The mission will
                    obtain near simultaneous images of the different layers of the Sun's atmosphere, which reveal the
                    ways in which the energy may be channeled and transferred from one layer to another. Thus the
                    Aditya-L1 mission will enable a comprehensive understanding of the dynamical processes of the Sun
                    and address some of the outstanding problems in solar physics and heliophysics.</p>

                <h3>Significance and Potential Discoveries</h3>
                <p>
                    The Aditya-L1 mission holds the promise of significantly advancing our understanding of the Sun's
                    behavior and its interactions with Earth and the space environment. The planned observations and
                    data collection from this mission could lead to several groundbreaking discoveries and insights in
                    the field of solar and heliophysics:
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><i><b>Coronal Heating Mechanism:</b></i> One of the central puzzles in solar physics is the
                        coronal heating problem - why the Sun's corona is much hotter than its surface. Aditya-L1's
                        instruments, particularly the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) and the Visible
                        Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), will enable detailed studies of the corona's dynamics and
                        composition. By closely examining the behavior of the corona, scientists hope to unravel the
                        mechanisms responsible for heating this outer layer of the Sun.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i><b>Space Weather Prediction:</b></i> Understanding the Sun's behavior is crucial for
                        predicting space weather events, which can have significant impacts on Earth's technology and
                        infrastructure. The mission's data will provide insights into the processes that lead to solar
                        flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and solar energetic particle (SEP) events. These insights
                        can contribute to more accurate forecasting of space weather phenomena and their potential
                        effects on communication systems, satellites, and power grids.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i><b>Solar Wind and Magnetic Field Studies:</b></i> Aditya-L1's instruments like the Aditya
                        Solar wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX) and the Magnetometer will offer a comprehensive view of
                        the solar wind's properties and the interplanetary magnetic field. This data will help refine
                        models of the solar wind's behavior and its interaction with Earth's magnetosphere, shedding
                        light on the dynamics of this critical space environment.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i><b>Understanding Earth's Climate:</b></i> The Sun's activity can influence Earth's climate
                        over long timescales. Aditya-L1's observations of near-UV solar radiation and its impact on
                        Earth's upper atmosphere can contribute to understanding how solar variability might affect
                        Earth's climate patterns. This could provide valuable information for climate researchers
                        seeking to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic factors driving climate change.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i><b>Comprehensive Solar Atmosphere Imaging:</b></i> The suite of instruments on Aditya-L1 will
                        provide multi-wavelength observations of the Sun's atmosphere, from the photosphere to the
                        corona. These simultaneous observations will allow scientists to trace the flow of energy and
                        matter between different layers, offering insights into the complex processes that govern the
                        Sun's behavior.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i><b>Origin and Dynamics of CMEs:</b></i> Coronal mass ejections are powerful and potentially
                        disruptive solar events. Aditya-L1's observations of the initiation and evolution of CMEs will
                        contribute to our understanding of their origins and behavior, potentially leading to improved
                        models for predicting their occurrence and effects.</li>
